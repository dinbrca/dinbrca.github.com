# mallabee Toolchain

## What is it?

mallabee Toolchain is a collective API of resource based tools.

We create a set of technological advanced, super simple web tools.

We strive to make the tools for the public use - we do that by allowing others to easily interact and automate (e.g.: using [**Zapier**](https://zapier.com/developer/public-invite/110808/ab56aed0459357f3c7aaee1149fedcbd/)).

The tools sit on top of Amazon infrastructure (AWS) to allow scalability as we grow our toolset.

The tools are grouped - each resource / object type has it's functionallities / actions for example: Images -> Resize Image.
