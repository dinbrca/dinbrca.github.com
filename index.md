## mallabee Toolchain

### What is it?

mallabee Toolchain is a collective API.

We create a set of technological advanced, super simple web tools.

We strive to make the APIs for the public use - we do that by allowing others to easily interact and automate (e.g.: using [**Zapier**](https://www.getpostman.com/)).

The tools sit on top of Amazon infrastructure (AWS) to allow scalability as we grow our toolset.

### Toolset

The current toolset contains only:

- Image Resizing

But the future holds a lot of feature possibilities:

- Image Compression
- Website Thumbnail Generation
- File Antivirus Scanning
- File Upload

and lots more to come.. (this is your time to shine and tell us through support what's your needs and request a feature)

#### Image Resizing

Check our [**Zapier**](https://www.getpostman.com/) integration in here to see how you can automate.

### API

The API is super simple.

All you need in order to start using it is having an API key.

Currently, you can just use a random generated UUID version 4 as API key because the API is free.

You can generate a UUID version 4 API key in [here](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/) (just use the random generated key on the top as your API key, e.g. `ebb6c59f-c00e-4ec3-9cce-41c5eb11d2ba`).

## Postman
