### SDK

#### General Idea

The idea is to open an SDK for programmers and let anyone create a tool based on pre-defined core & core values, performance & scalability.

The API objects are supposed to be "short-lived" objects, that usually doesn't require a database, only a function of a "do" action.

Having a core & core values, with a set of superrior tooling will potentially allow programmers that use the SDK to create a new tool within a couple of days (even a day) and not weeks.

#### What Does the Core SDK Gives a Programmer

- Logging & Exception Handling
- Background Work Handling (such as webhooks)
- API Key Based Authentication
- Core Services (such as Storage, HTTP Client, Image Utilities)
- Validations
- Error Handling
- Hassle-free AWS Resource Integrations - DynamoDB, S3
- Operations Audit Log
- Background Job Processing
- Request, Response & Exception - Log & Handling
- Testing Framework
- Hassle-free Zapier Integration

##### Future:
- Cron Job Processing
