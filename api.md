### API

The API is super simple.

All you need in order to start using it is having an API key.

Currently, you can just use a random generated UUID version 4 as API key because the API is free.

You can generate a UUID version 4 API key in [here](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/) (just use the random generated key on the top as your API key, e.g. `ebb6c59f-c00e-4ec3-9cce-41c5eb11d2ba`).
